## **1.**  Pre-installation

### Get the StrawberryOS Installation image
Currently, we only provide Installation Images via GitHub Actions.

### Prepare your boot medium
There are many different ways to start the StrawberryOS installer.
You can flash the image on a USB stick, burn a CD/DVD, boot from a PXE netboot server, or use Ventoy.

### Boot the Installer
Start from the StrawberryOS boot medium containing the installer.
You can do this by going to the boot menu after switching on your computer.
To do this, you usually have to press a specific key, for example F12.

### First steps
After you have started from your installation medium, you will land in a console where the bash shell is started.
If you are from a region outside the USA, you may want to change your keyboard layout.
The default keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:

```
# localectl list-keymaps
```
or
```
# ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386/<your_layout>
```
