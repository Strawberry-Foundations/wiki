## **1.**  Pre-installation
---
### Get the StrawberryOS Installation image
Currently, we only provide Installation Images via GitHub Actions.

### Prepare your boot medium
There are many different ways to start the StrawberryOS installer.
You can flash the image on a USB stick, burn a CD/DVD, boot from a PXE netboot server, or use Ventoy.

### Boot the Installer
Start from the StrawberryOS boot medium containing the installer.
You can do this by going to the boot menu after switching on your computer.
To do this, you usually have to press a specific key, for example F12.

### First steps
After you have started from your installation medium, you will land in a console where the bash shell is started.
If you are from a region outside the USA, you may want to change your keyboard layout.
The default keymap is US. Available layouts can be listed with:

```
# localectl list-keymaps
```
or
```
# ls /usr/share/keymaps/i386/<your_layout>
```

To select a different keyboard layout, you must enter the name of your desired keyboard layout as the argument of the loadkeys command. For the German keyboard layout as follows:

```
# loadkeys de-latin1
```

### Verify the boot mode
To check whether your computer supports UEFI, you can check the UEFI-Bitness.

```
# cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
```

If this command returns `64`, it means that your computer supports UEFI and you have booted with UEFI. 
If the command fails, it means that your computer does not support UEFI or was not started with UEFI. 

### Network
Make sure you are connected to the Internet if you want to continue with the installation. 
You can execute the following command to enumerate your connections:

```
# ip link
```

You can then check whether your connection is working by pinging a server of your choice:

```
# ping strawberryfoundations.xyz
```
