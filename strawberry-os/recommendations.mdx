# The very first step
Before you start with the post-installation, you must first chroot into your base system.
Some of the following processes require direct access to the base system. 
As the base partition was mounted read-only, it must first be made writable. Our `fsmgr` tool will help you:

```
# fsmgr system shell
```

## **1.**  Users
A new installation of StrawberryOS only has the superuser named `root`.
This user has all rights, but this is not safe if you want to use StrawberryOS as a desktop operating system. 

You can therefore create a new user who does not have root rights by default. 
To add a new user, you can use the useradd command: 
```
(SystemRoot) # useradd -m -G some_group -s shell username
```
| Placeholder | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| some_group  | A permission group for the user, e.g. `sudo`, `kvm`, `libvirt`, ... |
| shell       | Login shell for the user, e.g. `/bin/bash` |
| username    | Username of the user |

Now change the password of the user:
```
(SystemRoot) # passwd username
```

## **2.**  Graphical user interface (Desktop)
Having a graphical user interface simplifies many tasks.
Without a desktop, hardly any software works - so you should install a desktop.

```
(SystemRoot) # tasksel
```
